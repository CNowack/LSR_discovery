# recombinase_search
Search bacterial genomes for MGEs and identify LSRs within found MGEs

The goal of this code is to recapitulate the search performed by Durrant, Fanton et al. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01494-w).

Steps:
 1. Use GenomeSearch to identify MGEs (https://github.com/bhattlab/GenomeSearch)
 2. Homology search for LSRs
 3. Profit
